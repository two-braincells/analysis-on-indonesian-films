    "# Introduction\n",
    "<b>A</b>s a cinephile, it is challenging to find good films. I had spent more time picking titles than watching them because I had seen most horror movies in the market — Shudder, Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos. Early in the pandemic, I watched up to three titles a week because stay-at-home mandate made it possible.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>M</b>ost of the movies I watched had the same generic recipe — someone with no common sense; a couple of horny voyeurs; someone who wanders on their own thinking they could survive the danger; someone who purposely chooses to ignore warnings; someone who follows creepy sounds or unnatural sightings; the sole survivor. <u>It lacks great plotline.</u>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>J</b>oko Anwar's <i>\"Pengabdi Setan (2017)\"</i> and <i>\"Perempuan Tanah Jahanam (2019)\"</i> were memorable, especially since Indonesian horror titles have a bad rep for focusing on corny jokes or adult themes. James Wan's <i>\"The Conjuring (2013)\"</i> and <i>\"The Conjuring 2 (2016)\"</i> made me anticipate next installments of his work, but it grew stale as I could predict the next jumpscare. Some underrated international titles are <i>\"The Whole Truth (2021)\"</i>, <i>\"Fear Street Trilogy (2021)\"</i> and <i>\"The 8th Night (2021).”</i> However, these titles were rarely the talked about.\n",

    "<b>A</b>nd so, this project was created. I hope to find binge-worthy horror titles by analyzing reviews and notable film directors. Horror films are rather niche — on a normal circumstance, people do not want to see disfigured faces or gore. Therefore, I have no expectation of finding new titles to watch."
